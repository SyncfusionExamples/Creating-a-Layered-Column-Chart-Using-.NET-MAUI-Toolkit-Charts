# Creating a Layered Column Chart Using .NET MAUI Toolkit Charts to Visualize European Accommodation Trends in 2024

This sample delves into building a Layered Column Chart using the Syncfusion **.NET MAUI Toolkit Charts** to visualize real-world data from the European accommodation sector.

## Layered Column Chart
* A Layered Column Chart is a variation of the traditional column chart where multiple series are stacked with varying widths, creating a layered visual effect. 
* Unlike side-by-side columns, layered columns overlap slightly, allowing multiple metrics to be compared within the same category without consuming extra horizontal space.

This visualization is grounded in the findings of the **2024 European Accommodation Barometer**, a comprehensive survey conducted by Statista in collaboration with Booking.com. The report captures the evolving sentiment and operational challenges faced by hoteliers across Europe in the wake of the post-pandemic travel surge.

Take a look at the final output of the layered column chart, fully customized to visualize the real world data more effectively.
